# Minecraft-Style Map Viewer

This project simulates a **Minecraft-style map** by generating a blocky, grid-based map with random textures (like grass, dirt, and stone) and displaying it on an interactive map. The project uses **Python** with **Folium** for map creation, **Pillow** for image generation, and **Webview** to display the map in a web window.

## Features

- Generates a map with **Minecraft-like blocks** (grass, dirt, stone).
- Uses the **current location** based on IP for map center.
- Displays the map in an interactive webview window.
- Simulates a grid of Minecraft blocks in a simple and randomized manner.

## This project is not complete so the generated map looks very bad
